create modified/derivate/whatever NFTs without transferring the original token or having to approve anything (for use with services such as Twitter Blue) - think ["soulbound"](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html), but actually bound to the owner of the original token

examples are available in the [examples](examples/) folder
